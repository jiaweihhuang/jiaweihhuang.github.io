I'm a Ph.D. student in <a href="https://inf.ethz.ch/">Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://ethz.ch/en.html">ETH Zurich</a>, advised by Prof. <a href="https://odi.inf.ethz.ch/niaohe.html">Niao He</a>. Before that, I was a Ph.D. student in <a href="https://cs.illinois.edu/">Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://illinois.edu/">University of Illinois at Urbanaâ€“Champaign (UIUC)</a>, advised by Prof. <a href="http://nanjiang.cs.illinois.edu/">Nan Jiang</a>. I completed my B.E. in Computer Science at Beihang University.

My research primarily focuses on reinforcement learning (RL) and, more broadly, sequential decision-making under uncertainty.
I work on understanding the fundamental mathematical principles underlying the problems and leveraging theoretical insights to develop efficient and practical algorithms.
I'm particularly interested in bridging the gap between theory and practice, designing algorithms that come with theoretical supports and demonstrate empirical performance.

My previous research spans a broad spectrum of topics including:
- **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**: Developing methods to align AI with human preferences.
- **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)**: Understanding learning efficiency in multi-agent systems.
- **Offline Reinforcement Learning**: Advancing learning algorithms in offline setting.
